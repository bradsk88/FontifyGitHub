### What's important? 
- Putting the best results somewhere that the developer will see them
  - Ideally, our results would be indistinguishable from other Google results.
  - We could still have the vsearch box at the top but also include the top 
  result from each source interspersed with the other results from the Google 
  search
  
### Strategies
- Limit distraction
  - I've heard of several people turning off vsearch because it pushes search 
  results down in an annoying way because it loads slightly after the Google 
  results page.  
  - To get around this, we could load the vSearch results in below the content 
  that is visible in the browser.
